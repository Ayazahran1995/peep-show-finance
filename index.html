        const financeTerms = [
            { term: "Overdraft", explanation: "An overdraft is your bank saying, â€˜Go on then, have some money you donâ€™t have.â€™ But the catch is, itâ€™s actually their money, and theyâ€™ll want it back. With interest. And disappointment." },
            { term: "Credit Score", explanation: "Your credit score is basically a trust rating given to you by an algorithm that decided, years ago, that you were financially irresponsible. And it's never forgiven you." },
            { term: "Savings Account", explanation: "A savings account is a magical place where you put your money so the bank can use it, while giving you just enough interest to afford half a Tesco meal deal after a decade." },
            { term: "Investing", explanation: "Investing is gambling, but if you do it in a suit, itâ€™s called â€˜financial planning.â€™ The stock market is basically a mood ring for rich people." },
            { term: "Crypto", explanation: "Crypto is digital magic beans. Sometimes they make you rich, sometimes they make you cry, and usually, they do both in the same week." },
            { term: "Inflation", explanation: "Inflation is when everything costs more, but your salary stays the same. Itâ€™s like trying to run up an escalator thatâ€™s going down. And it's on fire." },
            { term: "NFTs", explanation: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except thereâ€™s no painting. Just the â€˜vibesâ€™ of a painting. Oh, and your vibes are now worth 3p." },
            { term: "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)", explanation: "Buy Now, Pay Later is basically Future Youâ€™s problem. Except Future You is already drowning in bad financial decisions. Cheers, mate." },
            { term: "Pension", explanation: "A pension is a slow-motion heist where you spend decades trying to save enough money to retire, but by the time you do, theyâ€™ve moved the goalposts to â€˜work until you drop.â€™" },
            { term: "Mortgage", explanation: "A mortgage is a 25-year deal where you rent from the bank, except instead of a landlord, you have an interest rate that judges you." },
            { term: "Hedge Funds", explanation: "A hedge fund is just a way for rich people to gamble using money that isn't theirs, and when they lose, the government buys them a new yacht." },
            { term: "Recession", explanation: "A recession is when the economy has a panic attack and suddenly everyone pretends they didnâ€™t see it coming. Again." }

            "Savings Account": "You give the bank your money. They give you dust in return.",
            "Investing": "Legal gambling, but only if you're rich or lucky.",
            "Crypto": "Sometimes you win, mostly you lose. But hey, decentralization!",
            "Inflation": "Everything gets more expensive. Your salary doesnâ€™t. Enjoy.",
            "NFTs": "You own the idea of a thing, not the thing itself. Congrats.",
            "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)": "You buy things now. Future You suffers later.",
            "Pension": "You save money for retirement. By the time you retire, itâ€™s not enough.",
            "Mortgage": "You rent from the bank for decades. Theyâ€™re your new landlord.",
            "Hedge Funds": "Rich people gamble with other peopleâ€™s money. Itâ€™s fine. For them.",
