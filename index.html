                explanation: "A credit score is an algorithm's way of keeping tabs on your financial history. It quietly notes every loan, payment, and overdraft, then sums up your trustworthiness in a single number. That number decides how easy, or painful, borrowing money will be. No drama, just math. And judgement.",

                explanation: "Unicorns might be fictional, but in VC, the odds of finding one are slim, never zero. VC is placing 100 bets, knowing 90 will fail spectacularly, but the 10 that win might just buy them an island. One big win makes all the losses worth it.",

            "Credit Score": "You apply for a credit card and get rejected. The letter says, 'We regret to inform you.' You regret everything - but you start looking up ways to rebuild. There's always a way forward.",
            "Savings Account": "You check your savings after a year and see 12p in interest. You laugh, but remind yourself - small steps are still steps.",
            "Investing": "You invest in a 'sure thing' stock. It drops 80% in a week. You tell yourself it's a 'long-term investment' - and honestly, it might be. Or at least a great story for future you, sipping wine but wiser.",
            "Crypto": "You buy £100 of Dogecoin because Elon Musk tweeted about it. A week later, it's worth £12. You tell yourself it's a 'long-term investment,' but deep down, you know you've been scammed. Still, you've officially joined the 'I tried crypto' club. Badges pending.",
            "Inflation": "You go to the shop and bread is £5. You pause, overwhelmed - but think, 'Time to get creative.' You adapt - and that's powerful.",
            "NFTs": "You drop £500 on a rare Pepe NFT. A week later, it's worth £3. Maybe next time, just get a meal from Pepe's - at least that comes with fries. But hey, in the grand meme economy, every Pepe finds its moment. Yours just might be ahead.",
            "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)": "You buy a new TV with BNPL. A month later, you're eating instant noodles for every meal. Future You is judging Present You hard, but Present You is watching Netflix in HD — and learning to budget better. Character development!",
            "Pension": "You check your pension and it says you'll retire at 85. You laugh, but know it's not too late. Small steps matter.",
            "Mortgage": "You finally get a mortgage. The bank says, 'Congrats, you're now in debt for 25 years.' You celebrate by crying with pride into instant coffee. Because you've worked hard for this, and you'll handle what comes next.",
            "Venture Capital": "You? You put £100 in a stock, and when it drops 20%, you stare at your screen like it's a betrayal. Personal finance isn't venture capital. You don't get to lose 90% and still win. But maybe you're the next unicorn VC is betting on.",
            "Recession": "It's a recession. Your mate says, 'At least you've got your health!' You laugh awkwardly - because hey, you've handled worse, and you'll figure this out too."
