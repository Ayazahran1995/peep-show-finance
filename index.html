            overdraft: "An overdraft is your bank saying, â€˜Go on then, have some money you donâ€™t have.â€™ But the catch is, itâ€™s actually their money, and theyâ€™ll want it back. With interest. And disappointment.",
            
            credit_score: "Your credit score is basically a trust rating given to you by an algorithm that decided, years ago, that you were financially irresponsible. And it's never forgiven you.",
            
            savings_account: "A savings account is a magical place where you put your money so the bank can use it, while giving you just enough interest to afford half a Tesco meal deal after a decade.",
            
            investing: "Investing is gambling, but if you do it in a suit, itâ€™s called â€˜financial planning.â€™ The stock market is basically a mood ring for rich people.",
            
            crypto: "Crypto is digital magic beans. Sometimes they make you rich, sometimes they make you cry, and usually, they do both in the same week.",
            
            inflation: "Inflation is when everything costs more, but your salary stays the same. Itâ€™s like trying to run up an escalator thatâ€™s going down. And it's on fire.",
            
            nfts: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except thereâ€™s no painting. Just the â€˜vibesâ€™ of a painting. Oh, and your vibes are now worth 3p.",
            
            bnpl: "Buy Now, Pay Later is basically Future Youâ€™s problem. Except Future You is already drowning in bad financial decisions. Cheers, mate.",
            
            pension: "A pension is a slow-motion heist where you spend decades trying to save enough money to retire, but by the time you do, theyâ€™ve moved the goalposts to â€˜work until you drop.â€™",
            
            mortgage: "A mortgage is a 25-year deal where you rent from the bank, except instead of a landlord, you have an interest rate that judges you.",
            
            hedge_funds: "A hedge fund is just a way for rich people to gamble using money that isn't theirs, and when they lose, the government buys them a new yacht.",
            
            recession: "A recession is when the economy has a panic attack and suddenly everyone pretends they didnâ€™t see it coming. Again."
