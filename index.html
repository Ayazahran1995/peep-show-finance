            savings_account: "A savings account is where you put your money so the bank can use it, while you earn less interest than inflation steals from you.",
            investing: "Investing is gambling, but when rich people do it, it’s called ‘wealth management.’",
            crypto: "Cryptocurrency is like magic internet money that sometimes makes you rich and sometimes makes you cry.",
            inflation: "Inflation is when your money is still money, but it buys you less than it did last week.",
            nfts: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except the painting doesn’t exist, and you can’t hang it on your wall.",
            bnpl: "Buy Now, Pay Later is a scheme where you trick yourself into thinking you can afford something. Future You will be furious.",
            pension: "A pension is like a very slow-growing plant that you hope will feed you when you're old, unless the government accidentally steps on it.",
            mortgage: "A mortgage is renting from the bank, but instead of a landlord, you have debt for 25 years.",
            hedge_funds: "Hedge funds are like a casino for rich people, except when they lose, they take your tax money to stay afloat.",
