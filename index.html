                term: "Overdraft",
                explanation: "An overdraft is your bank saying, â€˜Go on then, have some money you donâ€™t have.â€™ But the catch is, itâ€™s actually their money, and theyâ€™ll want it back. With interest. And disappointment."
            },
            {
                term: "Credit Score",
                explanation: "Your credit score is basically a trust rating given to you by an algorithm that decided, years ago, that you were financially irresponsible. And it's never forgiven you."
            },
            {
                term: "Savings Account",
                explanation: "A savings account is a magical place where you put your money so the bank can use it, while giving you just enough interest to afford half a Tesco meal deal after a decade."
            },
            {
                term: "Investing",
                explanation: "Investing is gambling, but if you do it in a suit, itâ€™s called â€˜financial planning.â€™ The stock market is basically a mood ring for rich people."
            },
            {
                term: "Crypto",
                explanation: "Crypto is digital magic beans. Sometimes they make you rich, sometimes they make you cry, and usually, they do both in the same week."
            },
            {
                term: "Inflation",
                explanation: "Inflation is when everything costs more, but your salary stays the same. Itâ€™s like trying to run up an escalator thatâ€™s going down. And it's on fire."
            },
            {
                term: "NFTs",
                explanation: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except thereâ€™s no painting. Just the â€˜vibesâ€™ of a painting. Oh, and your vibes are now worth 3p."
            },
            {
                term: "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)",
                explanation: "Buy Now, Pay Later is basically Future Youâ€™s problem. Except Future You is already drowning in bad financial decisions. Cheers, mate."

            {
                term: "Pension",
                explanation: "A pension is a slow-motion heist where you spend decades trying to save enough money to retire, but by the time you do, theyâ€™ve moved the goalposts to â€˜work until you drop.â€™"
            },
            {
                term: "Mortgage",
                explanation: "A mortgage is a 25-year deal where you rent from the bank, except instead of a landlord, you have an interest rate that judges you."
            },
            {
                term: "Hedge Funds",
                explanation: "A hedge fund is just a way for rich people to gamble using money that isn't theirs, and when they lose, the government buys them a new yacht."

            {
                term: "Recession",
