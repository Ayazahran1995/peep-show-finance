            { term: "Overdraft", explanation: "An overdraft is your bank saying, â€˜Go on then, have some money you donâ€™t have.â€™ But the catch is, itâ€™s actually their money, and theyâ€™ll want it back. With interest. And disappointment." },
            { term: "Credit Score", explanation: "Your credit score is basically a trust rating given to you by an algorithm that decided, years ago, that you were financially irresponsible. And it's never forgiven you." },
            { term: "Savings Account", explanation: "A savings account is a magical place where you put your money so the bank can use it, while giving you just enough interest to afford half a Tesco meal deal after a decade." },
            { term: "Investing", explanation: "Investing is gambling, but if you do it in a suit, itâ€™s called â€˜financial planning.â€™ The stock market is basically a mood ring for rich people." },
            { term: "Crypto", explanation: "Crypto is digital magic beans. Sometimes they make you rich, sometimes they make you cry, and usually, they do both in the same week." },
            { term: "Inflation", explanation: "Inflation is when everything costs more, but your salary stays the same. Itâ€™s like trying to run up an escalator thatâ€™s going down. And it's on fire." },
            { term: "NFTs", explanation: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except thereâ€™s no painting. Just the â€˜vibesâ€™ of a painting. Oh, and your vibes are now worth 3p." },
            { term: "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)", explanation: "Buy Now, Pay Later is basically Future Youâ€™s problem. Except Future You is already drowning in bad financial decisions. Cheers, mate." },
            { term: "Pension", explanation: "A pension is a slow-motion heist where you spend decades trying to save enough money to retire, but by the time you do, theyâ€™ve moved the goalposts to â€˜work until you drop.â€™" },
            { term: "Mortgage", explanation: "A mortgage is a 25-year deal where you rent from the bank, except instead of a landlord, you have an interest rate that judges you." },
            { term: "Hedge Funds", explanation: "A hedge fund is just a way for rich people to gamble using money that isn't theirs, and when they lose, the government buys them a new yacht." },
            { term: "Recession", explanation: "A recession is when the economy has a panic attack and suddenly everyone pretends they didnâ€™t see it coming. Again." }

            "Credit Score": "You apply for a credit card and get rejected. The letter says, â€˜We regret to inform you.â€™ You regret everything â€” but then you start looking up ways to rebuild. Because thereâ€™s always a way forward.",
            "Savings Account": "You check your savings account after a year and see 12p in interest. You laugh, but also remind yourself â€” small steps are still steps. Youâ€™re building something, even if itâ€™s slow.",
            "Investing": "You invest in a stock that seemed like a sure thing. It drops 80% in a week. You sit with the shock for a moment, but remind yourself â€” everyone starts somewhere. Learning curves are real, and youâ€™ll make wiser choices next time.â€™",
            "Crypto": "You buy Â£100 of Dogecoin after seeing it online. A week later, itâ€™s worth Â£12. You take a deep breath and remind yourself: youâ€™re learning, and every lesson has value â€” even the expensive ones.",
            "Inflation": "You go to the supermarket and see bread costs Â£5. You pause, overwhelmed â€” but then you think, 'Okay, time to get creative.' You swap brands, try new recipes. Youâ€™re adapting â€” and thatâ€™s powerful.",
            "NFTs": "You spend Â£500 on an NFT. A week later, itâ€™s worth Â£3. You wonder what you were thinking, but also â€” now you know. Everyone makes mistakes with money. Youâ€™ll make better ones next time",
            "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)": "You buy a TV on BNPL. A month later, you're eating noodles for every meal. You smile to yourself â€” because now you know the cost of 'buy now.' And next time, you'll be ready.",
            "Pension": "You check your pension and it says youâ€™ll retire at 85. You laugh, but also think â€” itâ€™s not too late to start. Small steps today can make a big difference later. Youâ€™ve got time."",
            "Mortgage": "You finally get a mortgage after years of saving. The bank says, â€˜Congratulations, youâ€™re now in debt for the next 25 years.â€™ You celebrate by crying into a cup of instant coffee.",
            "Hedge Funds": "You read about hedge funds in the news. They lost billions. The government bailed them out. You lost Â£20 on a bad bet. No one bailed you out , But you're a tough cookie, and bouncing back is what you do.",
            "Recession": "The recession hits. Your mate says, â€˜At least youâ€™ve got your health!â€™ You laugh it off â€” because yeah, itâ€™s rough, but youâ€™re tougher."
