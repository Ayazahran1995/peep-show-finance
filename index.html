    const financeTerms = [ { term: "Overdraft", explanation: "An overdraft is your bank saying, â€˜Go on then, have some money you donâ€™t have.â€™ But the catch is, itâ€™s actually their money, and theyâ€™ll want it back. With interest. And disappointment." },
            { term: "Credit Score", explanation: "Your credit score is basically a trust rating given to you by an algorithm that decided, years ago, that you were financially irresponsible. And it's never forgiven you." },
            { term: "Savings Account", explanation: "A savings account is a magical place where you put your money so the bank can use it, while giving you just enough interest to afford half a Tesco meal deal after a decade." },
            { term: "Investing", explanation: "Investing is gambling, but if you do it in a suit, itâ€™s called â€˜financial planning.â€™ The stock market is basically a mood ring for rich people." },
            { term: "Crypto", explanation: "Crypto is digital magic beans. Sometimes they make you rich, sometimes they make you cry, and usually, they do both in the same week." },
            { term: "Inflation", explanation: "Inflation is when everything costs more, but your salary stays the same. Itâ€™s like trying to run up an escalator thatâ€™s going down. And it's on fire." },
            { term: "NFTs", explanation: "NFTs are like buying an expensive painting, except thereâ€™s no painting. Just the â€˜vibesâ€™ of a painting. Oh, and your vibes are now worth 3p." },
            { term: "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)", explanation: "Buy Now, Pay Later is basically Future Youâ€™s problem. Except Future You is already drowning in bad financial decisions. Cheers, mate." },
            { term: "Pension", explanation: "A pension is a slow-motion heist where you spend decades trying to save enough money to retire, but by the time you do, theyâ€™ve moved the goalposts to â€˜work until you drop.â€™" },
            { term: "Mortgage", explanation: "A mortgage is a 25-year deal where you rent from the bank, except instead of a landlord, you have an interest rate that judges you." },
            { term: "Hedge Funds", explanation: "A hedge fund is just a way for rich people to gamble using money that isn't theirs, and when they lose, the government buys them a new yacht." },
            { term: "Recession", explanation: "A recession is when the economy has a panic attack and suddenly everyone pretends they didnâ€™t see it coming. Again." }

const scenarios = {
    "Overdraft": "You check your balance and see you're Â£50 overdrawn. You call the bank, and they say, 'Just pay us back with interest.' You sigh, eat beans from the can, and remind yourself â€” this is temporary. You'll get back on top.",
    "Credit Score": "You apply for a credit card and get rejected. The letter says, 'We regret to inform you.' You regret everything â€” but you start looking up ways to rebuild. There's always a way forward.",
    "Savings Account": "You check your savings after a year and see 12p in interest. You laugh, but remind yourself â€” small steps are still steps.",
    "Investing": "You invest in a â€˜sure thingâ€™ stock. It drops 80% in a week. You tell yourself itâ€™s a â€˜long-term investmentâ€™ â€” and honestly, it might be. Or at least a great story for future you, sipping wine but wiser.",
    "Crypto": "You buy Â£100 of Dogecoin because Elon Musk tweeted about it. A week later, itâ€™s worth Â£12. You tell yourself itâ€™s a â€˜long-term investment,â€™ but deep down, you know youâ€™ve been scammed. Still, youâ€™ve officially joined the 'I tried crypto' club. Badges pending.",
    "Inflation": "You go to the shop and bread is Â£5. You pause, overwhelmed â€” but think, 'Time to get creative.' You adapt â€” and that's powerful.",
    "NFTs": "You drop Â£500 on a rare Pepe NFT. A week later, itâ€™s worth Â£3. Maybe next time, just get a meal from Pepeâ€™s â€” at least that comes with fries. But hey, in the grand meme economy, every Pepe finds its moment. Yours just might be ahead.",
    "Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)": "You buy a new TV with BNPL. A month later, youâ€™re eating instant noodles for every meal. Future You is judging Present You hard, but Present You is watching Netflix in HD â€” and learning to budget better. Character development!",
    "Pension": "You check your pension and it says you'll retire at 85. You laugh, but know it's not too late. Small steps matter.",
    "Mortgage": "You finally get a mortgage. The bank says, 'Congrats, you're now in debt for 25 years.' You celebrate by crying with pride into instant coffee. Because youâ€™ve worked hard for this, and youâ€™ll handle what comes next.",
    "Hedge Funds": "You read about hedge funds in the news. They lost billions. The government bailed them out. You lost Â£20 on a bad bet. No one bailed you out â€” but now you know to invest like a tortoise, not a gambler. Lesson learned.",
    "Recession": "Itâ€™s a recession. Your mate says, â€˜At least youâ€™ve got your health!â€™ You laugh awkwardly  â€” because hey, youâ€™ve handled worse, and youâ€™ll figure this out too."
